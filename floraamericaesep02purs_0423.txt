The Edinburgh Reviewers, at the conclusion of their review of “ Dr. Smith’s
Introduction to Botany,²² observe that “ Botany is daily becoming a more fa-
shionable female study; and tbi-s is an elementary book which may be put
with confidence into the hands of women, without any ris-k of wounding the
most delicate mind. We are happy, for the sake of those fair students‚ to
observe, that Dr. Smith promises a translation of his Flora Britannica5 for
this, we doubt not, will, when accomplished by Dr. Smith himen] form the
best popular Herb'al ever published. In the mean time he very candidly re.-
commends Dr. Withering's Arrangement of British Plants: to which we would
take the liberty to add Mr. Galpine’s Compendium of Bi-itish Botany, (which
is indeed nearly a translation of Dr. Smith‘s Compendium Florae BrizannicaeQ
as a most useful and counnodions pocket companion in botanical excuisionsn’
