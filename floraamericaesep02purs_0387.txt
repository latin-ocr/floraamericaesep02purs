Slzerard. Flowers the size and colour of the preced-
ing. While writing the genus Gcrardia, Ι strongly
suspected G. ι assioia'es to be a distinct genus, which al-
ready had been considered so by Walter and Gmelin.
Having no materialsthen at lmnd,1f0110wedthe authority
of Michaux. But finding in the Sherardian Hei-barium
not only that species, but also a new one described
here, I was convinced of its generic distinction, the
characterof which is well expressed in {Vult.fl. car.171.
I have named this genus in memory of the late Heni-y
Seymer, Esq. of Hanford, Dorsetshire‚ a gentleman
much celebrated for his extensive collections in natural
history, and for whom Dr. Solander had so great a re-
gard as to dedicate the plant which afterwards was
called Solaridm grandgfflora to his mernory, as l have
seen it named Seymera in the Herbarium of A. Β. Lam-
bert, Esq„ in Dr. Solander's own handwriting.
