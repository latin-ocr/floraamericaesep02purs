The eones are large and armed with strong spinos. The
cone figured t. 16. f. c. in Lambert. nzonogr. is ge-
nuine, but the branch belongs to a separate species.

longo-coniers deflexis folio brevioribus, spinis inflexis.

April, May. v. v. The Lohlofly or Oldfield Fine is
found in large tracts in the southern states: all the
woods seem to be seeded with it 3 sor when any piece
of cleared land is neglected for any space of time it
will be covered with those pines. It is difficult and in
some cases almost impracticable to recover those lande
run over with young pines, as‘ the ground appears to
have lost all fertile properties sor any other vegeta-
ble than those trees. 'she account Mr. Michaux gives
of this tree is very correct and instructive ; as also is
the plato of Mr. Lambert; but unfortunately the lat-
ter, considering P. tce-cla [Vanglz. amer. 41. a genuine
synonym, although it evidently belongs to P. rigida
or serotina, has inadvertently been led into some
errors in his description.

palustris. 16. P. foliis ternis longissimis, stipulis pinnatifidis ramenta-
ceis persistentibus, strobilis subcylindraceis muricatis.

, In the forests, near the sea-coast: North Carolina to
Florida. 122 . May. v. υ. The Long-lem·ed, Yellow,
Pitclz, or Broom Pine is a beautiful as well as very
useful tree. Mr. Lambert‘s remarks respecting the
quality of tlte wood he has taken from Wangen-
heim, whom he considers sufficient authori1y3 but
on the observations of Michaux respecting the male
flowers, he mentions in his note, ‘¹ I can only suppose
Mn Michaux has never scen my plato with the male
flowers, or he never would have made such an obser-
vation about them.'' ”
Strobus, 17. P. foliis quinis gracilibus, vaginis brevissimis, strobilis
pendulis cylindraceis folio longioribus, squamis laxis.
