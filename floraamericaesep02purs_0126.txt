It approaches very near to P. pentaphy lla Willd. sp.

pl.3.p.1352. which is fully described and figured by
B. Jussieu in A.ct par. 1744. p. 381. t. 17. t:But not
only the botanical difference, but the medical use
ma ‘ide of the Mexican plant, proves their distinctness.
The present plant pro duces the famous Bread- root of
the American &Vesz ern Indiaus, on which they partly
subsist m winter. They collect thern' 1n large quanti-
ties, andis for present use, they roast them in the ashes,
u hen theyt> <rive a food similar to yams: if intended
for w nter use, they are carelully dried, and preserved
iu 3 dry place in their huts. When wanted for use,
they are mashed between two stones, mixed with some
water, and baked in cakes over the coals. It is a
wholesome and nourishing food, and, according to
ΜΓ. Lewis’s observation² agreeable to most constitu-
tions 3 which, he observed‚ was not the case with the
rest of the roots collected by those Indians for sood.
This root has been frequently found by travellers in
the canoes of the Iudians, but the plant which pro-
duces it has not been known until lately.
